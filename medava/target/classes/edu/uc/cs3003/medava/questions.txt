1. How come you don't have to explicitly include for example, Hospital.java in the SupplyChain.java? Does Java just read from all files within a folder?  
2. This is my first exposure to using java, so in your opinion what are some good resources for further learning to write Java?
3. Can you only have one class per file? Or is using a ton of files purely organizational and for readability?
